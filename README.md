AFNetworking-Sharp
==================

Wrapper to the great [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) library for Xamarin iOS.

Lots of methods aren't fully supported yet, did enough to port the example app over to C#.

## How is this different from thefactory's version?

* We submodule AFNetworking and build it from scratch instead of bindropping it
* Some extra methods are added

This probably should've been a fork, but I had originally planned on adding 2.0 support but then decided against it.
Oops.
